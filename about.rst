This blog is intended to server as a place to record my inspiration about:

1. Hard and easy problem of consciousness
2. Auto-reasoning especially in mathematics area
3. Conlang which has a formal definition
4. Nature of music and art and their auto generator
5. Game design
6. Distributed system

In my case, I am interested in finding a formal model of a problem 
and automating the way to solve it.
